# About
This is my personal website. 

# History

I built my first hosted website on this repo back in April 2022 using React and Material UI libraries.

My first personal website I ever built was in July 2020. That was with pure HTML and CSS. However, in hindsight, I lacked the **depth** to really engineer the website. (I will probably look back at this in a couple of years and say the same thing)

Therefore, I'm updating it again in May of 2025 with the intention of maximally using purely CSS, HTML, and a potential sprinkle of JavaScript.
